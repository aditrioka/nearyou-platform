## ADR-001: Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) for Cross-Platform Development

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision Makers:** Development Team

### Context
We need to build a mobile application for both Android and iOS platforms while minimizing code duplication and ensuring consistency in business logic.

### Decision
Use Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) with Compose Multiplatform for shared UI and business logic across Android, iOS, and backend.

### Rationale
1. **Code Reuse:** Share domain models, validation logic, and data layer across platforms
2. **Type Safety:** Kotlin's strong type system reduces runtime errors
3. **Native Performance:** Compiles to native code for each platform
4. **Single Language:** Kotlin for frontend, backend, and shared code
5. **Compose Multiplatform:** Share UI components across Android and iOS
6. **Ecosystem:** Mature ecosystem with libraries like Ktor, SQLDelight, kotlinx.serialization

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Reduced code duplication (~60-70% code sharing)
  - Consistent business logic across platforms
  - Faster feature development
  - Easier maintenance
- **Negative:**
  - Learning curve for iOS-specific KMP patterns
  - Platform-specific code still needed for some features
  - Smaller community compared to React Native/Flutter

### Alternatives Considered
- **React Native:** JavaScript-based, larger community, but performance concerns
- **Flutter:** Dart language, excellent UI framework, but separate backend language
- **Native Development:** Maximum control, but high code duplication

The application requires efficient geospatial queries to find posts within a specific radius (1-20 km) of a user's location.

### Decision
Use PostgreSQL 15+ with PostGIS extension for geospatial data storage and queries.

### Rationale
1. **Geospatial Support:** PostGIS provides robust geospatial functions (ST_DWithin, ST_Distance)
2. **Performance:** GiST indexes enable fast radius queries (<100ms for millions of records)
3. **ACID Compliance:** Strong consistency guarantees for critical data
4. **Mature Ecosystem:** Well-documented, widely adopted, extensive tooling
5. **Cost-Effective:** Open-source, no licensing fees
6. **Scalability:** Supports read replicas, partitioning, and connection pooling

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Excellent geospatial query performance
  - Strong data consistency
  - Rich SQL feature set
  - Proven scalability
- **Negative:**
  - Requires PostGIS extension setup
  - Vertical scaling limits (mitigated by read replicas)
  - More complex than NoSQL for some use cases

### Alternatives Considered
- **MongoDB with Geospatial Indexes:** Good geospatial support, but weaker consistency guarantees
- **MySQL with Spatial Extensions:** Less mature geospatial support than PostGIS
- **Elasticsearch:** Excellent for search, but not ideal as primary database

6. **KMP Compatibility:** Share code between backend and frontend

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Seamless integration with KMP shared code
  - Excellent performance with coroutines
  - Type-safe routing and serialization
  - Smaller footprint than Spring Boot
- **Negative:**
  - Smaller ecosystem compared to Spring Boot
  - Fewer built-in features (need to add plugins)
  - Less enterprise tooling

### Alternatives Considered

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision Makers:** Development Team

### Context
We need a secure, scalable authentication mechanism for the API.

### Decision
Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication with 7-day access tokens and 30-day refresh tokens.

### Rationale
1. **Stateless:** No server-side session storage required
2. **Scalable:** Works well with horizontal scaling
3. **Standard:** Industry-standard, well-supported

5. **Flexible:** Can include custom claims (user ID, subscription tier)

### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Stateless authentication enables easy horizontal scaling
  - No database lookup for every request
  - Works well with mobile apps
- **Negative:**
  - Cannot revoke tokens before expiry (mitigated by short expiry + refresh tokens)
  - Token size larger than session IDs
  - Requires secure token storage on client

### Alternatives Considered
- **Session-Based Auth:** Requires server-side storage, harder to scale
- **OAuth 2.0 Only:** More complex for simple use cases
- **API Keys:** Less secure, no expiry mechanism
