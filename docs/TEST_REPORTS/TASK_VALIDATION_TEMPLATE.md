## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Validation Mode
| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **validation_owner** | AI / HUMAN / HYBRID |
| **who_validated** | Name / ‚ÄúAI Agent‚Äù / Both |
| **ai_capability** | What AI can check (paths, docs, structure) |
| **human_prereq** | What human needs to do (e.g., external login, manual test) |
| **evidence_required** | Screenshots, quotes, URLs, timestamps |
| **pass_criteria** | Clear measurable result for PASS |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Validation Steps
Describe how the validation was performed.

Example:
1. Open updated docs:
   - [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md ‚Üí check section ‚ÄúClient-Server Interface‚Äù
   - [ ] SPEC.md ‚Üí ensure consistency with feature name
   - [ ] PROJECT_MAP.md ‚Üí confirm file paths
2. Verify correctness:
   - [ ] No TODO or placeholder remains  
   - [ ] All paths and links are valid  
   - [ ] Document matches plan and architecture
3. Manual/external actions (if needed):
   - [ ] Register on site X / test API endpoint Y  
   - [ ] Verify token or permission flow  
   - [ ] Capture screenshot evidence

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Evidence
Attach or describe proof of validation (copy snippets, screenshots, or notes).

Example:
- ‚ÄúVerified that PROJECT_MAP.md contains link to VIBECODE_SHORT_META_PROMPT.md.‚Äù  
- Screenshot of folder structure validation.  
- Output log from successful Gradle test.
