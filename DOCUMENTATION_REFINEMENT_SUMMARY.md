## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. Restructured Documentation Hierarchy

**Before:**
```
docs/
├── CORE/ (12 files including historical docs)
├── PLANS/ (3 files)
├── PROMPTS/ (1 file)
├── CHECKLISTS/ (1 file)
├── TASK_PLANS/ (task-specific plans)
├── TEST_REPORTS/ (test validation reports)
├── ARCHIVE/ (legacy files)
├── API_DOCUMENTATION.md (root level)
└── DEPLOYMENT_READY_SUMMARY.md (root level)

Root:
├── README.md
└── 04_DESIGN_SYSTEM_EXAMPLE.md
```

**After:**
```
docs/
├── CORE/ (11 essential files)
│   ├── PROJECT_MAP.md
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
│   ├── SPEC.md
│   ├── API_DOCUMENTATION.md (moved from root)

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional)

While the documentation is now optimized, future enhancements could include:

1. **Merge DEPLOYMENT_READY_SUMMARY into CHANGELOG** - Consolidate deployment status
2. **Create CONTRIBUTING.md** - Formal contribution guidelines
3. **Add GLOSSARY.md** - Technical terms and acronyms
4. **Create TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Common issues and solutions

These are optional and should only be done if explicitly requested.
